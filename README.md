# Cloud-Native Data Platform Framework

## Name of person/people proposing
* Ganesh Kumar

## Introduction

While Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration and is already pervasive across industries, the community lacks guidance on how to architect cloud-native, holistic solutions for stateful, data-centric workloads.

Resources that we believe would alleviate this challenge include a getting started guide, best practices, experience sharing, expert advice, learning resources to close skill gaps, and documentation to navigate through the wide-spread ecosystem of tools.

To better address this, the proposal is to create a cloud-native data platform framework that stands as a reference to design and build a fully functional platform on Kubernetes.

## Goals
* A Getting started guide with reference architectures, best practices, etc.
* Built using Open source projects and solutions
* Vendor agnostic
* Enterprise production grade and future-proof
* Living framework - Built once but refreshed regularly


## Non-goals
* No proprietary tools, technologies or solutions
* No vendor lock-in
* Not for sale - as a product or service
